I'm Isaac, an [Informatics][info] undergraduate in my junior year at the University of Washington, graduating in Spring 2015.

I'm a Seattle based UX designer and front end web developer. I enjoy learning new things and skills. I've recently started learning Swift and making latte art to complement my caffeine induced mornings.

Thanks for dropping by!

## This Site
I created this site with Jekyll, a static site generator. I considered several options prior to this: A WordPress powered site, a Bootstrap/Foundation based site, and even a full on Squarespace hosted site. 

I eventually settled with Jekyll as the main building block of this site because of its versatile and light weight nature. I can write posts in markup and also HTML! Isn't that awesome?
