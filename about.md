### About Me

{% image portraitIsaacKuek.jpg class="portrait" alt="Portrait of Isaac Kuek" %}


I'm a student in the [Informatics][info] Bachelor's program at the University of Washington focused on [Human Computer Interaction](https://ischool.uw.edu/current/informatics/degree-plan/options), graduating in June 2015. 

While studying, I've interned as a User Researcher at Amazon and as a UX Designer at Medbridge, a medical tech startup in Seattle.

### How I got into UX

After focusing on developing software and websites, I realized it was challenging to 'develop' [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) like those found in good video games and applications. During a class project in late 2013, I conducted my first user interview for a Wikipedia redesign concept and was immediately hooked with discovering their point of view and needs. Since then, I've focused on user experience design by taking HCI classes, [attending local UX meetups](http://www.meetup.com/SeattleUX/) and reading about User Experience design.

I have since gained experience in qualitative and quantitative research, usability testing for mobile and web, interaction design, wireframing and presenting design decisions to different audiences.

### In a UX Role, I enjoy:

#### __1. Collaborative [gamestorming](http://www.gamestorming.com)__
I value engaging the people involved in a project. Design artifacts and gamestorming activities help encourage conversations and connect projects to business goals. 

#### __2. Testing, and reiterating__
I find the most exciting phase of designing is observing actual users test a design in progress. Seeing their successes or failures effectively informs the team how to iterate future designs.
