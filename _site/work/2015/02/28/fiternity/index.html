<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>For my Senior Capstone Project, I joined a group of 4 as a <em>UX Lead</em> to build a mobile social application to facilitate fitness so people who don’t want to exercise alone can pair with people of compatible schedules or locations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ahmed Elkholy - Project Manager</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Isaac Kuek - UX Lead</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Nathan Booco - Developer</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Kevin Tsang - Developer</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal was to develop clickable prototypes in three months, and fully develop the application in the next three months, in time for our Capstone presentations. The challenge with our project is the fitness marketspace: There are countless fitness applications in the App Store and the Play Store.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do we differentiate ourselves with a fixed timeline and resource constraints?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="current-stages">Current Stages</h2>

<p><em>Project Proposal: Define Project Scope and work breakdowns</em></p>

<p><em>Discovery Brief: User Research, Comparative Analysis &amp; Persona Creation</em></p>

<p><em>Conceptual Design: Create Storyboards, User Flows, Mood Boards</em></p>

<p><strong>Usability Testing: Create Paper Prototypes, Conduct Usability Tests &amp; Design Iterations</strong></p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>After defining our goals and target audiences, we began interviewing our target audiences to gather their perceptions of exercising with a partner. We interviewed students, working professionals, and fitness trainers and found that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fitness trainers wanted to use this service to gain clients and earn money.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People were concerned about their privacy, and wanted granular control over who they would meet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People would be more likely to partner up with someone of equal expertise when exercising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We realized fitness trainers was not our core audience and wanted to focus more on the individuals seeking exercise partners. As such, we had to refine our feature list and target audiences.</p>

<p>To internalize our findings, we created 2 personas based on the results of our interviews. This helped us relate back to our target audience during future stages of the design.</p>

<h2 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>We conducted a brief comparative analysis, looking at web and mobile applications such as <strong>VirtuaGym, Meetup.com,</strong> and <strong>Fitness Against Friends</strong> to understand what aspects of fitness other services addressed.</p>

<p><em>A member of our cohort pointed out Reddit as a source of information, from which we gathered more insight into the marketspace!</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>We discovered that a lot of applications utilized only Facebook as an authentication service and were focused on personal fitness improvement rather than finding matching exercise partners.</p>

<h2 id="conceptual-desings">Conceptual Desings</h2>

<p>I held a sketching session with the team, encouraging them to generate rough sketches of a part of the interface they wanted. This started really broad at first, but it became clear to us that our individual sketches needed to be weaved together in some way. To arrive at our user goals, we brainstormed potential use cases based on our two personas as a team, creating a rough user journey map with our initial sketches:</p>

<h2 id="wireframes-and-user-flows">Wireframes and User Flows</h2>

<p>Concurrently, we needed to conceptualize how a user would perform tasks through our app. I used OmniGraffle to put together a user flow detailing 3 main tasks our app would provide:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fiternity/userFlowIllustrator-05014cfaca231c982952f552730ddf6e.png" />
<img src="/assets/fiternity/userFlowIllustrator2-64b413f0e63c67cb1ea9e20952baf028.png" /></p>

<p>Completing user flows allowed us to then visualize the main interactions on each screen. This process was extremely helpful because it helped the team generate consensus and alignment on the user flow and what elements should be shown on the page.</p>

<p><strong>Protip: The larger the marker’s tip and the smaller the screen you draw, the more concise and direct sketches will be.</strong></p>

<img src="/assets/fiternity/wireframes2-d668a1d6df94458b298cf31ef27e48dc.png" /></p>

<p>We wanted to tailor the application to both our personas and promote an active and vibrant feel. I created two Mood Board candidates and discussed the different design directions with the team.</p>

<img src="/assets/fiternity/MoodBoard2-Web-596eab2c15f2a3d25971bc76cad4f29a.png" /></p>

<p>After several rounds of feedback from the team and our fellow classmates, we decided on a mood board that had the best of both previous designs..</p>
