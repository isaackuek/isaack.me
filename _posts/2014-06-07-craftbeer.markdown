About the Project
---

American Craft Beer has rapidly developed over the past decade. Having sampled many beers from craft breweries in the Seattle area, I made an infographic to show the history and development of craft beer over time. 

The task was to exploit the visual potential of information categorized into location, numbers, appearance, relationships and time based on a topic of choice.

The Rise of Craft Beer Infographic was a final project deliverable for an Information Visualization course focusing on visual design.
