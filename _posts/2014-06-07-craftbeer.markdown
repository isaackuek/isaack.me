Introduction
---

The Rise of Craft Beer Infographic was a final project deliverable for an Information Visualization course focusing on visual design.

The task was to exploit the visual potential of information categorized into location, numbers, appearance, relationships and time based on a topic of choice.

Craft beer had an interesting development in the US and I sought to compile an infographic that would show what craft beer was and show its development over time.
