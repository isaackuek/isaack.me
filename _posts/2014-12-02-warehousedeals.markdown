Introduction

**Timeline**: 3 months

**Team**: [Jason Levine][jasonPortfolio], [Yuliya Baran][yuliyaPortfolio], [Troy Griffiths][troyPortfolio], [Mariam Davis][mariamLinkedIn], [Victoria Baxter][victoriaLinkedIn], Isaac Kuek

The Amazon Warehouse Deals storefront that sells discounted open-box products had not undergone a redesign since its initial release and was buried a few pages within Amazonâ€™s homepage. 

Our user research concluded with valuable customer data, the common pathways visitors used, and design recommendations for the redesign of the Warehouse Deals storefront.

To increase customer conversion, our **user research goals** were to:

- > Identify pathways visitors used to reach the storefront
- > Identify usability issues with the storefront and its discoverability
- > Quantitatively analyze Amazon Warehouse Deals customers


Design Process

**Competitive Analysis**

We began by analyzing competiting online retailers (Ebay, Overstock, etc.) and identifying best design practices that may be applicable to Warehouse Deals storefront.

**Survey Design**

We designed 2 surveys to achieve separate goals. I designed the main survey to identify habits of online shoppers and potential Warehouse Deals users. Our second survey, focused at Warehouse Deals users, was to identify popular purchases on the storefront and to screen potential customers for our usability interviews. Both surveys underwent several iterations amongst the group to reduce bias and ambiguous questions.

**Usability Test Design**

We designed our usability test to find out how users navigated to the storefront and also identify usability issues of the storefront itself. The tasks that we designed required several iterations and internal testing to prevent preconditioning and biases from skewing our results.

**Remote Usability Interviews**

After testing and rehearsing our usability scripts, we began our remote interviews with customers and performed testing in pairs. We faced challenges documenting our results consistently between teams. As such, I created an internal form for the scribe to input his/her data systematically into a spreadsheet for easier analysis.

**Data Analysis**

After we completed the interviews, we analyzed the recordings and our field notes to identify customer trends and usability issues with the storefront. Our results and findings were then used to support our design recommendations for the storefront redesign.
