Introduction
---
The YellowCab mobile app redesign is our final project for INFO 330, an Information Architecture class instructed by Jason Levine.

Our task was to design a convenient mobile app for YellowCab that allows customers to use social media to share cab rides, on top of the normal tasks a cab booking app provides.

The challenge was to create a unified experience, addressing the needs of each persona while keeping the interface simple to use.

Our final deliverables were a class presentation and a working hi-fi prototype.

Design Process
---
- **Define** the problem through a competitive audit of ridesharing alternatives (Lyft, Uber, Zipcar, Flywheel)
- Performed **user research** by using personas and conducting user interviews
- **Ideate** designs with the aid of mind maps, sketches and user flows
- Built **paper prototypes** to perform initial usability test with users and stakeholders
- Built **high-fidelity wireframes** as final deliverable

Contribution
---
- Performed market research of ridesharing alternatives
- Conducted user interviews to augment user personas created and source for potential features
- Brainstormed and sketched few iterations of paper prototypes
- Created high-fidelity wireframes in Sketch

Tools
---
- Sketch
- Omnigraffle
- InvisionApp
